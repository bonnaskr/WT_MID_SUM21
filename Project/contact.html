                 healthcare staff provide a VIS to a patient, parent, or legal
                 representative before each dose of certain vaccinesBangladesh 
                 began administration of COVID-19 vaccines on 27 January 2021 
                 mass vaccination started on 7 February 2021.[

                 Oxford–AstraZeneca vaccine was the only COVID-19 vaccine that was
                 authorized for emergency use from January to April 2021. Bangladesh 
                 ordered vaccine produced by Serum Institute of India, however it 
                 delivered less than half of the doses as agreed with Bangladesh government.
                 After the vaccine shortage due to this, Bangladesh approved Russian Sputnik
                 V and Chinese BBIBP-CorV vaccines for emergency use in late April 2021.
                 Bangladesh has also authorized the emergency of Pfizer–BioNTech COVID-19 
                 vaccine and to be distributed as part of COVAX. It was reported that the 
                Bangladesh government planned to give permission to Bangladeshi made Bangavax
                 developed by Globe Biotech Ltd.[6] to conduct the first clinical trial that got 
                listed in the 'Draft landscape and tracker of Covid-19 candidate vaccines'
                by the World Health Organization .However fate of the Bangavax is
                still uncertain due to an unknown reason.As of May 2021, Bangladesh has 
                not fully approved any COVID-19 vaccine. All the four vaccines got emergency 
               authorization only.</td>
